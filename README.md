# Cracking Practice

This is a repository of my solutions for the interview questions found within [Cracking the Coding Interview]
(http://smile.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X?sa-no-redirect=1). Bear in 
mind that these may not be the most optimal solutions (hence why I am practicing :P), 
but I still feel that sharing my answers to these problems as I continue my studying will be valuable to others.
